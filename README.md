OpenClassRoom project 5 where you need to implant a SQLite database to an application already developed.
During this project, I transformed the given code to implement MVVM design pattern but make little modification to the given design.
I implemented hilt-dagger to use dependency injection
I redo all unit test and instrumented test.

The purpose of this application is to let collaborators know the list of tasks to do in a cleaning project.

With this app, you can:
- Create a new task;
- Check all existing tasks associated to a project;
- Sort tasks by chronological/anti-chronological order or sort projects by alphabetical/anti-alphabetical order;
- Delete a task.
